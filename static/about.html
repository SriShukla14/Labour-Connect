        <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
        <p>
          Labour Connect is the result of dedicated efforts from a passionate 
          team and the generous support of many valued contributors. We would 
          like to express our heartfelt thanks to the open source community, 
          local laborers, early users, and partner organizations who helped 
          shape this platform. Their feedback, expertise, and encouragement 
          have been invaluable in creating a service that truly serves the 
          needs of both workers and those seeking labor. Without their 
          collaboration, this project would not have been possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are especially grateful to those who have contributed code, 
          reported issues, designed UX improvements, and advocated for fair 
          labor practices. Their spirit of openness and collaboration 
          embodies the core values of Labour Connect. We also thank our user 
          community for their trust and active participation in building a 
          trustworthy and accessible labor marketplace.
